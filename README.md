## 🎉 his-birthday

A minimal, interactive birthday microsite crafted as a personal digital experience for a friend.  
Designed to feel thoughtful, immersive, and calm—without unnecessary gimmicks.

This isn’t just a “birthday wish”.  
**It’s a moment.**

## ✨ What Makes This Special

- 🎶 Cinematic background music (starts intentionally, never intrusive)  
- 🖥️ Matrix-style visual atmosphere  
- 🧊 Glassmorphism message card for a premium look  
- 🕰️ Time-aware messages (changes based on time of day)  
- 📅 Date-based logic (special messages appear only on the birthday)  
- 🔐 Gesture-based unlock (swipe up / tap to begin)  
- 🥚 Hidden easter egg (for the curious and observant)  
- 📱 Mobile-first & responsive  
- 🚫 No ads, no tracking, no noise  

Everything is subtle by design.  
**Less flash, more feeling.**

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Restraint over excess  
- Emotion over effects  
- Intentional interaction over autoplay chaos  

Every interaction exists for a reason.  
If it doesn’t add meaning, it doesn’t belong.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Glassmorphism, subtle animations)  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- Local audio (browser-policy compliant)  
- Touch + keyboard interaction support  

No frameworks.  
No dependencies.  
Just clean, understandable code.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. Page loads silently with a minimal start screen  
2. User performs a gesture (swipe up / tap) to unlock  
3. Visuals + music + message appear together  
4. Time-based and date-based messages adjust automatically  
5. Optional hidden easter egg rewards curiosity  

Everything runs locally and reliably across modern browsers.

## 📷 Browser Compatibility Notes

- Audio starts **only after user interaction** (by design, per browser rules)  
- Works on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari (desktop & mobile)  
- Graceful degradation: if a feature isn’t supported, the experience still runs
